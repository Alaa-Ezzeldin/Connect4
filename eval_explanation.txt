We have implmented a evaluation function for depth limited minimax in order to calculate the utility value which will be used by the 
algorithm to determine the next best possible move.
The computer will choose the highest utlity value it finds while calculating and it will choose the corresponding column to play its
next move.
Firstly it will check if it can get consecutive fours, then threes and lastly twos.
Here we calculate the number of possible fours, threes and twos that the human can make and subtract them from the opponent.

utility_value = (my_fours * 10 + my_threes * 5 + my_twos * 2)- (comp_fours *10 + comp_threes * 5 + comp_twos * 2).
Once the utility values are calculated, the column which has the highest corresponding value is choosen and then the move is played.
